# EpubMetadataReader
A library for getting all of the metadata from an epub.

## Features
The EpubMetadataReader can quickly pull all of an Epub's information from within the OPF files located within. 

## The Future
This currently only supports Epub 2.0 files. (It will read 3.0 files, but miss some data) - Support for 3.0 will be added in the future.
